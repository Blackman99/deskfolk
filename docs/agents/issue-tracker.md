# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Local implementation issues and specs live as markdown files in `.scratch/`. This directory is ignored by Git and is not required in a public checkout. Use the hosting repository's Issues and pull requests for public discussion; keep shared decisions and acceptance evidence there or in `docs/`. The public direction is in [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md).

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` — never a single combined tickets file
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/` (creating the directory if needed).

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user will normally pass the path or the issue number directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md` — the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `open` / `claimed` / `resolved`. Unclaimed means `Status: open`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every file it lists is `resolved`. Use `Blocked by: —` when none.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked, and unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
- **Refer by name**: in narration and on the map, use the ticket title, wrapping the path, never a bare `01`.
